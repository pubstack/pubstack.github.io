Let's say bye bye and thanks to the old them I used for the last 3 years.

I created this blog, [Anstack](https://www.anstack.com),
just after joining Red Hat. This with the purpose of
logging part of my upstream work within the [TripleO](https://www.tripleo.org)
community.

It evolved in such a way that I'm currently adding other types of posts, like
management, hobbies, software development posts,
other cloud computing technologies, talks, among many other things.

I had a milestone in which after 70 posts, the current theme
do not scale up correctly anymore.


That's why I welcome the new theme and I thank the
old one for holding for the last years.
