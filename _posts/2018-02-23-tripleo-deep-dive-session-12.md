This is the 12th release of the [TripleO](http://www.tripleo.org/) "Deep Dive" sessions

Thanks to [James Slagle](http://blog-slagle.rhcloud.com/) for this new session, in which he
will describe and speak about a feature called `config-download`.

In this session we will have
an update for the TripleO
ansible integration called
`config-download`.
It's about aplying all the software
configuration with Ansible instead
of doing it with the Heat agents.

So please, check the full [session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6ojHT8P4RE)
content on the [TripleO YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNGDxZGwUELpgaBoLvABsTA/).
