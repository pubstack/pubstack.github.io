This is the seven release of the [TripleO](http://www.tripleo.org/) "Deep Dive" sessions

In this session Liz Blanchard and Ana Krivokapic will give us some
bits about how to contribute to the [TripleO UI](https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ui) project.
Once checking this session we will have a general overview about the project's
history, properties, architecture and contributing steps.

So please, check the full [session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TseONVfLR8)
content on the [TripleO YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNGDxZGwUELpgaBoLvABsTA/).
