Implementing cloud computing solutions that runs in hybrid environments might
be the final solution when comes to finding the best benefits/cost
ratio.

This post will be the main thread to build and describe the KIAB/Kubebox
project ([www.kubebox.org](http://www.kubebox.org) and/or [www.kiab.org](http://www.kiab.org)).

Spoiler alert!

# The name

First thing first, the name.. I have in my mind two names having the same meaning.
The first one is KIAB (Kubernetes In A Box) this name came to my mind as
the [Kiai](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiai)
sound from karatekas (practitioners of karate).
The second one is more
traditional, "Kubebox". I have no preference but
it would be awesome if you help me
to decide the official name for this project.

# Introduction

This project is about to integrate together already market
available devices to run cloud software as an appliance.

The proof-of-concept delivered in this series of posts will allow people
to put a well-known set of hardware devices into a single chassis for
either create their own cloud appliances, research and development,
continuous integration, testing, home labs, staging or production-ready
environments or simply just for fun.

Hereby it's humbly presented to you the design of KubeBox/KIAB
an open chassis specification for building cloud appliances.

The case enclosure is fully designed, and hopefully in the last phases
for building the first set of enclosures, now, the posts will appear
in the mean time I have some free cycles for writing  the overall description.

# Use cases
Several use cases can be defined to run on a KubeBox chassis.

* AWS outpost.
* Development environments.
* EDGE.
* Production Environments for small sites.
* GitLab CI integration.
* Demos for summits and conferences.
* R&D: FPGA usage, deep learning, AI, TensorFlow, among many others.
* Marketing WOW effect.
* Training.

# Enclosure design

The enclosure is designed as a rackable unit,
using 7U. It tries to minimize the space used to deploy
an up to 8-node cluster with redundancy for both power and networking.

# Cloud appliance description

This build will be described across several sub-posts
linked from this main thread.
The posts will be created particularly without any specific order
depending on my availability.

* Backstory and initial parts selection.
* Designing the case part 1: Design software.
* A brief introduction to CAD software.
* Designing the case part 2: U's, brakes, and ghosts.
* Designing the case part 3: Sheet thickness and bend radius.
* Designing the case part 4: Parts Allowance (finish, tolerance, and fit).
* Designing the case part 5: Vent cutouts and frickin' laser beams!.
* Designing the case part 6: Self-clinching nuts and standoffs.
* Designing the case part 7: The standoffs strike back.
* A brief primer on screws and PEMSERTs.
* Designing the case part 8: Implementing PEMSERTs and screws.
* Designing the case part 9: Bend reliefs and flat patterns.
* [Designing the case part 10: Tray caddy, to be used with GPU, Mother boards, disks, any other peripherals you want to add to the enclosure.](https://www.pubstack.com/blog/2019/05/22/kubebox-01-tray.html)
* Designing the case part 11: Components rig.
* Designing the case part 12: Power supply.
* Designing the case part 13: Networking.
* Designing the case part 14: 3D printed supports.
* Designing the case part 15: Adding computing power.
* Designing the case part 16: Adding Storage.
* Designing the case part 17: Front display and bastion for automation.
* Manufacturing the case part 1: PEMSERT installation.
* Manufacturing the case part 2: Bending metal.
* Manufacturing the case part 3: Bending metal.
* KubeBox cloud appliance in detail!.
* Manufacturing the case part 0: Getting quotes.
* Manufacturing the case part 1: Getting the cases.
* Software deployments: Reference architecture.
* Design final source files for the enclosure design.
* KubeBox is fully functional.
